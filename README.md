# 3D-printing
A collection of microscopy-related 3D-printable designs that you maybe want.

These files have been modified from the [3D printing repo](https://github.com/ZhuangLab/3D-printing) from the Zhuang Lab. The files of objects that are made up of multiple parts have been split in seperate files and rotated for best 3D printing result. Files were modified using the free software [OpenSCAD](https://www.openscad.org/).

This repository contains files for:
* Nikon Ti-Eclipse filter cube
* Nikon emission filter holder for 1 filter
* Nikon emission filter holder for 3 filters
* _More to come ..._

The designs have been tested with a Nikon Eclipse Ti-U.
